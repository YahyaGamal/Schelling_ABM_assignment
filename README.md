To run the model in the `assignment.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, you need to install the following packages:
- `numpy` version 1.26.4
- `matplotlib` version 3.10.0
- `ipython` version 8.32.0

To install these libraries, run the following command (executed in a command prompt window at the directory where the GitHub repository files have been downloaded and saved):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command to install the libraries without navigating the command prompt to the directory where the `requirements.txt` file is saved
```
pip install numpy==1.26.4 matplotlib==3.10.0 ipython==8.32.0
```

If you face issues with the Python libraries installation and cannot run the model in the Jupyter notebook, you can run an online version of the model through this [NetLogo Web link](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Segregation.nlogo) (note that the `similarity_threshold` is labelled as `%-similar-wanted` in the NetLogo version).
